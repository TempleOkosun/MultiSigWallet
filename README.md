# MultiSig Wallet With Onchain Signature Verification

<h2> Project Description </h2>
A multi signature wallet smart contract. The contract will help store tokens safely by having multiple
people hold ownership of one address or set of funds. Such a wallet will help avoid a single point of
failure and split responsibilities of ownership of address and its funds. Multiple user authenticating
transactions will also prevent malicious activities.


<h2> Problem </h2>
As more organizations adopt blockchain especially with the growth in DeFi, the first step is usually the
need for a wallet to hold funds. Multi-signature wallets offer a good balance between security and
convenience and well suits the structure and needs of an organization. With possible fears of losing
keys or theft of a hardware wallet which makes it almost impossible to recover the funds or losing
funds when a wallet provider who is the actual owner of your private key is hacked as we have seen in
the parity hack of 2017 as well as Crypto exchanges hack of 2019, the need for extra layer of security
and recover-ability cannot be overlooked.

<h2> Goal </h2>
The goal of this project is to apply the learned concepts in advance smart contracts development course
including; optimization, security, and efficiency through off-chain computations to develop an
improved multisig wallet inculcating best practises and principles.
<hr>

<h2> Other use cases for Multi-Signature wallets </h2>
<ul>
    <li> <strong> Voting for decisions: </strong> A 4-of-6 multi-signature wallet can let a board vote for decisions. 
    Only when the majority of the board members pass the decision will the funds be allocated. </li>
    <li> <strong> Escrowing transactions: </strong>   A 2-of-3 wallet can be used among the seller, buyer, and a trusted
        arbiter. If goods are as expected, both the seller and buyer can sign the transaction for payment.
        If there is a dispute, the trusted arbiter will step in and provide the signature to either party
        based on the judgment. </li>
    <li> <strong> Two-factor authentication : </strong>   as provided by the smart contract wallet implementation. </li>    
    
</ul>

<h2> Disclaimer </h2>
This project is a school project and not for production use. While the concepts are true and multisig
wallet implementations by ConsenSys and Gnosis were referenced, there is still a lot to do and given
the limited time frame for submission, functionalities were prioritized to proof as well as have a useful
wallet.

<h2> Major Components </h2>
<ul>
    <li> <strong> Owners: </strong> A list of addresses who have the access right </li>
    <li> <strong> Approvals: </strong> Rules to approve submitted transaction ( 2 of 3, 3 of 4 etc) </li>
    <li> <strong> Funding: </strong> A means of funding wallet </li>
    <li> <strong> Transactions: </strong> Submitting and managing transaction. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Project Structure </h2>
Standard truffle project folders with addition of coverage report folder as well as a scripts folder which contains a
script to generate an off chain signature.
<hr>

<h2> Development Tools </h2>
<ul>
    <li> Truffle </li>
    <li> Solidity </li>
    <li> Javascript </li>
</ul>
<hr>


<h2> Smart Contract Vulnerabilities handled and other improvements incorporated </h2>
<ul>
    <li> Protected functions by specifying roles that should be allowed to invoke the 
        function and current state of data/transactions. </li>
    <li> Appropriate data types to optimize storage and prevent exploits. </li>
    <li> Arranging  variable and data declarations to 
        ensure optimal packing in storage </li>
    <li> Transaction ordering to prevent race conditions </li>
    <li> Mitigated replay attacks through checked nonces and 
    contract address inclusion in hashed message. </li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2> How to run </h2>

Running the project follows similarb steps with every other truffle projects.
Steps:
<ol>
    <li> npm install: to install dependencies </li>
    <li> truffle migrate â€“reset: to deploy to local blockchain </li>
    <li> truffle test: to run tests </li>
    <li> ruffle run coverage: to see test coverage report </li>
    <li> In order to test the verifySignature function, you will have to use remix and connect to meta-mask 
        and be connected to the local running blockchain to have access to private keys.
       Get private key of an owner address and use the signOffchainTransaction script in the scripts folder, 
provide the required inputs and generate signature components. Pass the generated outputs to verifySignature 
        function and a new transaction should be submitted if valid.   </li>
</ol>
<hr>

<h2> To Do </h2>
<ul>
    <li> Fix automated test for verifySignature function. </li>
    <li> Modify verifySignature function to use inline assembly and save gas cost. </li>
</ul>
